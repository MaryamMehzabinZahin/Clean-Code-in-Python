# Clean Code in Python
**Clean code** is a set of rules and principles that helps to keep our code readable, maintainable, and extendable.
## How to write Clean variables in Python:

 1. we should use **nouns** for variable names
 2. We should use **meaningful** and **pronounceable** variable names
```text
#this is bad
a = 52
#this is good
age = 52
```
 3.  **same vocabulary** for the same type of variable is needed
```
# This is bad
client_first_name = 'Bob'
customer_last_name = 'Smith'

# This is good
client_first_name = 'Bob'
client_last_name = 'Smith'
```

 4. Names should be **descriptive/intention-revealing.** Other developers should be able to figure out what a variable stores just by reading its name.
 5.  We should always use **pronounceable** names.
 6. **Searchable** names are always preferred.
